The Top 5 most used Types of Force Action by Police in Minneapolis, MN area are Body Weight to Pin (Bodily Force type), Punches (Bodily Force type), Joint Lock (Bodily Force type), Personal Mace (Chemical Irritant type) and Push Away (Bodily Force type).\n",

This suggests that police use of force is correlated with ongoing political changes that themselves have an overall trend, but that exhibit significant variation. The lowest months on record are mid to late 2020, which correspond to an increase in discourse of police use of force after the high-profile case of George Floyd, who was killed by excessive and unwarranted use of police force, which resulted in intense public scrutiny of police force used. That police use of force rebounded abruptly in 2021 is troubling and warrants further scrutiny."

    "•\tBased on the subplots, Taser showed an overall increase, Bodily Force showed an overall decrease (with a slight increase from 2017 to 2019).  Chemical Irritant showed a sharp overall decrease.  From this we can observe that Taser and Bodily Force slowed the overall downward trend in total incidents, particularly from years 2017 – 2019, while Chemical Irritant followed the overall downward trend.\n",

A plot of total bodily force vs. year for 2015 – 2019 shows a downward trend in use of force.  A linear regression model follows this trend with an r-squared value of 0.750, implying that 75% of the observed data fits the regression model.  \n",
